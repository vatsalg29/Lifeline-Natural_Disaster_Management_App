# Lifeline-Natural_Disaster_Management_App
An app for providing critical info regarding people in "danger" to the rescuing authorities during natural disaster. 

# How does it work 
The home screen of the app shall have 2 options - "I am a rescue worker" and "I am a victim". On tapping at the first i.e. rescue option, there shall be an option to type the location of the area hit. Upon receiving the location, a signal will be sent to all the phones having this app in that area which shall trigger a speech assistant. This speech assistant can also be opened using the second option i.e. the victim option. The speech assistant shall ask a specific set of questions - 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Then the user will answer all these questions by voice, which shall be converted to text, processed for keywords and this data will be provided to the rescue workers in a structured manner to facilitate rescue operations.
